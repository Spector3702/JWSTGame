dying star (NGC3132)[r]
[r]
The dimmer star has been sending out rings of gas and dust for thousands of years in all directions,
and JWST has revealed for the first time that this star is covered in dust.[r]
The image on the left was shot by NIRCam of JWST,
while the other image shot by MIRI of JWST shows the second star is surrounded by dust.[r]
The brighter star is in an earlier stage of its stellar evolution and will probably eject its own planetary nebula in the future.[r]
